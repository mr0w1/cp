#About Hier Blocks

To save some room and make things look nicer I built the receiver demod chains as hier blocks.

The easiest way to get these is to download the .grc file, open it in GRC, and then click the generate code button.

Next, hit the reload blocks button and you should see a new category "Custom" pop up.

From these blocks you can just grab a demod block and not have to mess with building the demodulator.

You can change filter and demod settings and save the .grc as a new version if you want to build a modified demod block.
