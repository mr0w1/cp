# Repository for CP builds.

Things you care about --

The install procedures are here. Either copy/paste or make sure you're spelling things correctly.

All of the flowgraphs are in the grc_flowgraphs folder. More info on their use in the folder.

The hier blocks are in the...hier_blocks folder...crazy. You'll need these to make the main flowgraphs work properly. Again, more info in the folder.

Let me know if something doesn't make sense or doesn't work.
