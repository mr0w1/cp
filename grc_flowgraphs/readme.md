#Using the Flowgraphs

If you've installed everything properly, you have two options here. Download the .py and just execute it (open a terminal window, drop the file into it, and hit enter) or just double click the .py (depends on your distro setup).

Alternatively, you can open the .grc and run it from there, and also be able to see and edit all of the blocks.

If you use the terminal or GRC method you'll get the libe debug log as well as the GUI. If you just double click the .py, all you'll get is the GUI.

#Version Convention

All files ending in 'a' are alpha versions. In general, newer versions have more features and are more polished. I won't intentionally upload a broken file.

Once we get the new radios we'll move into beta. After that, we'll see what happens...release candidate or just straight to release.
