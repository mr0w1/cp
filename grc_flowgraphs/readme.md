#Using the Flowgraphs

If you've installed everything properly, you have two options here. Download the .py and just execute it (open a terminal window, drop the file into it, and hit enter) or just double click the .py (depends on your distro setup).

Alternatively, you can open the .grc and run it from there, and also be able to see all of the blocks.

If you use the terminal or GRC method you'll get the debug log. If you just double click the .py, all you'll get is the GUI.
